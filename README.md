# aayushi.github.io

Personal resume site for Aayushi Shanker with a dark-themed, single-page layout.

## Local development

Open `index.html` directly in a browser, or run a lightweight server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

## Deployment

Push changes to the `main` branch. The included GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/pages.yml`) builds the repository contents and deploys them to GitHub Pages automatically. Ensure Pages is configured to use the GitHub Actions workflow source under **Settings → Pages**.
